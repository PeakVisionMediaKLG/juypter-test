We will demonstrate that we will encounter problems, if we define the method `about` as a normal instance method or as a static method. We will start by defining `about` as an instance method:"

We had to create instances of the `Pet`, `Dog` and `Cat` classes to be able to ask what the class is about. It would be a lot better, if we could just write `Pet.about()`, `Dog.about()` and `Cat.about()` to get the previous result. We cannot do this. We will have to write `Pet.about(p)`, `Dog.about(d)` and `Cat.about(c)` instead.\n",

As we have learned previously in our tutorial, a staticmethod does not have a first parameter with a reference to an object. So about will have no parameters at all. Due to this, we are now capable of calling \"about\" without the necessity of passing an instance as a parameter, i.e. `Pet.about()`, `Dog.about()` and `Cat.about()`. Yet, a problem lurks in the definition of `about`. The only way to access the class info ```_class_info``` is putting a class name in front. We arbitrarily put in `Pet`. We could have put there `Cat` or `Dog` as well. No matter what we do, the solution will not be what we want:"
