    "In the previous two chapters of our Python tutorial, we learned how to use [Python properties](python3_properties.php) and even how to implement a custom-made property class. In this chapter you will learn  the details of descriptors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors were introduced to Python in version 2.2. That time the \"What's New in Python2.2\" mentioned: \"The one big idea underlying the new class model is that an API for describing the attributes of an object using descriptors has been formalized. Descriptors specify the value of an attribute, stating whether it’s a method or a field. With the descriptor API, static methods and class methods become possible, as well as more exotic constructs.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "A descriptor is an object attribute with \"binding behavior\", one whose attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor protocol. Those methods are ```__get__()```,  ```__set__()```, and   ```__delete__()```. \n",
    "\n",
    "If any of those methods are defined for an object, it is said to be a descriptor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Their purpose consists in providing programmers with the ability to add managed attributes to classes. The descriptors are introduced to get, set or delete attributes from the object's ```__dict__``` dictionary via the above mentioned methods.  Accessing a class attribute will start the lookup chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let a closer look at what is happening. Assuming we have an object ```obj```: What happens if we try to access an attribute (or property) ```ap```? \"Accesssing\" the attribute means to \"get\" the value, so the attribute is used for example in a print function or inside of an expression. Both the ```obj``` and the class belong to ```type(obj)``` contain a dictionary attribute ```__dict__```. This situation is viuslaized in the following diagram:\n",
