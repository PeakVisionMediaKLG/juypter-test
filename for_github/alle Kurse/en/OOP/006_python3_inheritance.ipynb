    "No object-oriented programming language would be worthy to look at or use, if it didn't support inheritance. Inheritance was invented in 1969 for Simula. Python not only supports inheritance but multiple inheritance as well. Generally speaking, inheritance is the mechanism  of deriving new classes from existing ones. By doing this, we get a hierarchy of classes. In most class-based object-oriented languages, an object created through inheritance (a \"child object\") acquires all, - though there are exceptions in some programming languages, - of the properties and behaviors of the parent object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, and this enables a class created through inheritance to inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class. This means that inheritance supports code reusability. The methods or generally speaking the software inherited by a subclass is considered to be reused in the subclass. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a directed graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass. A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class. Superclasses are sometimes called ancestors as well. There exists a hierarchical relationship between classes. It's similar to relationships or categorizations that we know from real life. Think about vehicles, for example. Bikes, cars, buses and trucks are vehicles. Pick-ups, vans, sports cars, convertibles and estate cars are all cars and by being cars they are vehicles as well. We could implement a vehicle class in Python, which might have methods like accelerate and brake. Cars, Buses and Trucks and Bikes can be implemented as subclasses which will inherit these methods from vehicle.\n",
