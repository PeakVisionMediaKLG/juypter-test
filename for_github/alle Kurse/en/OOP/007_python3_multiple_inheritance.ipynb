    "In the previous chapter of our tutorial, we have covered inheritance, or more specific \"single inheritance\". As we have seen, a class inherits in this case from one class. Multiple inheritance on the other hand is a feature in which a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. The critics point out that multiple inheritance comes along with a high level of complexity and ambiguity in situations such as the diamond problem. We will address this problem later in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The widespread prejudice that multiple inheritance is something \"dangerous\" or \"bad\" is mostly nourished by programming languages with poorly implemented multiple inheritance mechanisms and above all by improper usage of it. Java doesn't even support multiple inheritance, while C++ supports it. Python has a sophisticated and well-designed approach to multiple inheritance.\n",

    "The \"diamond problem\" (sometimes referred as the \"deadly diamond of death\") is the generally used term for an ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from a superclass A, and another class D inherits from both B and C. If there is a method \"m\" in A that B or C (or even both of them) has overridden, and furthermore, if it does not override this method, then the question is which version of the method does D inherit? It could be the one from A, B or C.\n",

Polymorphism is the state or condition of being polymorphous, or if we use the translations of the components \"the ability to be in many shapes or forms. Polymorphism is a term used in many scientific areas. In crystallography it defines the state, if something crystallizes into two or more chemically identical but crystallographically distinct forms. Biologists know polymorphism as the existence of an organism in several form or colour varieties. The Romans even had a god, called Morpheus, who is able to take any human form: Morheus appears in Ovid's metamorphoses and is the son of Somnus, the god of sleep. You can admire Morpheus and Iris in the picture on the right side.\n",

    "So, before we fall asleep, we get back to Python and to what polymorphism means in the context of programming languages. Polymorphism in Computer Science is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms. We can have in some programming languages polymorphic functions or methods, for example. Polymorphic functions or methods can be applied to arguments of different types, and they can behave differently depending on the type of the arguments to which they are applied. We can also define the same function name with a varying number of parameter.\n",
