    "This chapter of our tutorial is meant to deepen the understanding of multiple inheritance that the reader has built up in our previous chapter. We will provide a further extentive example for this important object oriented principle of the programming language Python. We will use a variation of our Robot class as the superclass. We will also summarize some other important aspects of object orientation with Python like properties. We will also work out the differences between overwriting, overloading and overriding. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example has grown during my onsite Python training classes, because I urgently needed simple and easy to understand examples of subclassing and above all one for multiple inheritance.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the superclass ```Robot``` we will derive two classes: A ```FightingRobot``` class and a ```NursingRobot``` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we will define a 'combination' of both the ```FightingRobot``` class and the ```NursingRobot``` class, i.e. we will implement a class ```FightingNurseRobot```, which will inherit both from ```FightingRobot``` and ```NursingRobot```. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with our ```Robot``` class: \n",
    "We use a private class attribute ```__illegal_names``` containing a set of names not allowed to be used for naming robots. \n",
    "\n",
    "By providing an ```__add__``` method we make sure that our robots are capable of propagating. The name of the resulting robot will be automatically created. The name of a 'baby' robot will consist of the concatenation of the names of both parents separated by an hyphen. If a parent name has a name containing a hyphen, we will use only the first part before the hyphen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robots will 'come to live' with a random value between 0 and 1 for the attribute ```health_level```. If the health_level of a Robot is below a threshold, which is defined by the class attribute ```Robot.__crucial_health_level```, it will need the nursing powers of a robot from the ```NursingClass```. To determine if a Robots needs healing, we provide a method ```needs_a_nurse``` which returns True if the value is below ```Robot.__crucial_health_level``` and False otherwise. "
