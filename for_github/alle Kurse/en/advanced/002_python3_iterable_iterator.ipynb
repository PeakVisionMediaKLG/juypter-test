    "This form of looping can be seen as iteration. Iteration is not restricted to explicit for loops. If you call the function sum, - e.g. on a list of integer values, - you do iteration as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is the difference between an iterable and an iterator?\n",
    "\n",
    "On one hand, they are the same: You can iterate with a for loop over iterators and iterables. Every iterator is also an iterable, but not every iterable is an iterator. E.g. a list is iterable but a list is not an iterator! An iterator can be created from an iterable by using the function 'iter'. To make this possible the class of an object needs either a method '```__iter__```', which returns an iterator, or a '```__getitem__```' method with sequential indexes starting with 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators are objects with a '```__next__```' method, which will be used when the function 'next()' is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is going on behind the scenes, when a for loop is executed? The for statement calls iter() on the object ( which should be a so-called container object), over which it is supposed to loop . If this call is successful, the iter call will return an iterator object that defines the method ```__next__()``` which accesses elements of the object one at a time. The ```__next__()``` method will raise a StopIteration exception, if there are no further elements available. The for loop will terminate as soon as it catches a StopIteration exception. You can call the ```__next__()``` method using the next() built-in function. This is how it works:"
