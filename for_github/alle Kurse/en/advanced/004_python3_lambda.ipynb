    "If Guido van Rossum, the author of the programming language Python, had got his will, this chapter would have been missing in our tutorial. In his article from May 2005 [\"All Things Pythonic: The fate of reduce() in Python 3000\"](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196), he gives his reasons for dropping lambda, map(), filter() and reduce(). He expected resistance from the Lisp and the scheme \"folks\". What he didn't anticipate was the rigidity of this opposition. Enough that Guido van Rossum wrote hardly a year later: \"After so many attempts to come up with an alternative for lambda, perhaps we should admit defeat. I've not had the time to follow the most recent rounds, but I propose that we keep lambda, so as to stop wasting everybody's talent and time on an impossible quest.\"\n",
    "We can see the result: lambda, map() and filter() are still part of core Python. Only reduce() had to go; it moved into the module functools.\n",
    "\n",
    "His reasoning for dropping them is like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an equally powerful alternative to lambda, filter, map and reduce, i.e. list comprehension\n",
    "- [List comprehension](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_list_comprehension.php)( is more evident and easier to understand\n",
    "- Having both list comprehension and \"Filter, map, reduce and lambda\" is transgressing the Python motto \"There should be one obvious way to solve a problem\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some like it, others hate it and many are afraid of the lambda operator. The lambda operator or lambda function is a way to create small anonymous functions, i.e. functions without a name. These functions are throw-away functions, i.e. they are just needed where they have been created. Lambda functions are mainly used in combination with the functions filter(), map() and reduce(). The lambda feature was added to Python due to the demand from Lisp programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of a lambda function is quite simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "lambda argument_list: expression\n",

    "The argument list consists of a comma separated list of arguments and the expression is an arithmetic expression using these arguments. You can assign the function to a variable to give it a name.\n",
