    "Usually, programmers and program developers spend a great deal of their time with debugging and testing. It's hard to give exact percentages, because it highly depends on other factors like the individual programming style, the problems to be solved and of course on the qualification of a programmer. Without doubt, the programming language is another important factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to program to get pestered by errors, as even the ancient Romans knew. The philosopher Cicero coined more than 2000 years ago an unforgettable aphorism, which is often quoted: \"errare humanum est\"*\n",
    "This aphorism is often used as an excuse for failure. Even though it's hardly possible to completely eliminate all errors in a software product, we should always work ambitiously to this end, i.e. to keep the number of errors minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kinds of Errors\n",
    "There are various kinds of errors. During program development there are lots of \"small errors\", mostly typos. Whether a colon is missing - for example, behind an \"if\" or an \"else\" - or the keyword \"True\" is wrongly written with a lower case \"t\" can make a big difference. These errors are called syntactical errors.**\n",
    "In most cases, syntactical errors can easily be found, but other type of errors are harder to solve. A semantic error is a syntactically correct code, but the program doesn't behave in the intended way. Imagine somebody wants to increment the value of a variable x by one, but instead of \"x += 1\" he or she writes \"x = 1\".\n",

    "This paragraph is about unit tests. As the name implies they are used for testing units or components of the code, typically, classes or functions. The underlying concept is to simplify the testing of large programming systems by testing \"small\" units. To accomplish this the parts of a program have to be isolated into independent testable \"units\". One can define \"unit testing\" as a method whereby individual units of source code are tested to determine if they meet the requirements, i.e. return the expected output for all possible - or defined - input data. A unit can be seen as the smallest testable part of a program, which are often functions or methods from classes. Testing one unit should be independent from the other units as a unit is \"quite\" small, i.e. manageable to ensure complete correctness. Usually, this is not possible for large scale systems like large software programs or operating systems.\n",

We check if the module has been started standalone, in which case the value of ```__name__``` will be ```__main__```. Please save the following code as \"fibonacci1.py\":\n",
