    "<img class=\"imgright\" src=\"../images/stairs_green_fog.webp\" alt=\"stairway to success with Python\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In our introduction to [regular expressions](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_re.php) of our tutorial we have covered the basic principles of regular expressions. We have shown, how the simplest regular expression looks like. We have also learnt, how to use regular expressions in Python by using the search() and the match() methods of the re module. The concept of formulating and using character classes should be well known by now, as well as the predefined character classes like \\d, \\D, \\s, \\S, and so on. You must have learnt how to match the beginning and the end of a string with a regular expression. You must know the special meaning of the question mark to make items optional. We have also introduced the quantifiers to repeat characters and groups arbitrarily or in certain ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must also be familiar with the use of grouping and the syntax and usage of back references.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we had explained the match objects of the re module and the information they contain and how to retrieve this information by using the methods span(), start(), end(), and group().\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction ended with a comprehensive example in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will continue with our explanations about the syntax of the regular expressions. We will also explain further methods of the Python module re. E.g. how to find all the matched substrings of a regular expression. A task which needs programming in other programming languages like Perl or Java, but can be dealt with the call of one method of the re module of Python. So far, we only know how to define a choice of characters with a character class. We will demonstrate how to formulate alternations of substrings in this chapter of our tutorial, \n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding all Matched Substrings\n",
    "The Python module re provides another great method, which other languages like Perl and Java don't provide. If you want to find all the substrings in a string, which match a regular expression, you have to use a loop in Perl and other languages, as can be seen in the following Perl snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "while ($string =~ m/regex/g) {\n",
    "  print \"Found '$&'.  Next attempt at character \" . pos($string)+1 . \"\\n\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a lot easier in Python. No need to loop. We can just use the findall method of the re module:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre> re.findall(pattern, string[, flags]) </pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "findall returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order in which they are found.\n",

    "The general syntax:\n",

    "<tr><td><b>Abbreviation</b></td><td><b>Full name</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td>re.I</td><td>re.IGNORECASE</td><td>Makes the regular expression case-insensitive</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td>re.L</td><td>re.LOCALE</td><td>The behaviour of some special sequences like \n",
    "\\w, \\W, \\b,\\s, \\S will be made dependent on the current locale, i.e. the user's language, country etc.</td></tr>\n",

    "character properties</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td>re.X</td><td>re.VERBOSE</td><td>Allowing \"verbose regular expressions\", i.e. \n",
    "whitespace are ignored. This means that spaces, tabs, and carriage returns are not matched as such. \n",
    "If you want to match a space in a verbose regular expression, you'll need to escape it by escaping it \n",
    "with a backslash in front of it or include it in a character class.<br>\n",
    "# are also ignored, except when in a character class or preceded by an non-escaped backslash.\n",

    "used to start a comment. \n",
    "</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled regular objects usually are not saving much time, because Python internally compiles AND CACHES regexes whenever you use them with re.search() or re.match(). The only extra time a non-compiled regex takes is the time it needs to check the cache, which is a key lookup of a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good reason to use them is to separate the definition of a regex from its use.\n",
