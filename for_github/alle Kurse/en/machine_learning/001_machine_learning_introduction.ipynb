    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI). So what is Artificial Intelligence?\n",
    "\n",
    "Andrew Moore, former Dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, defined it as follows: \"Artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of making computers behave in ways that, until recently, we thought required human intelligence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The question \"What is artificial intelligence?\" depends on the answer to a more general question: \"What is intelligence?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "It shows extremels hard to answer the previous question.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get closer to the answers we can divide AI into to partitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**weak AI** and **strong AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "weak AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- deals with specific application problems\n",
    "- Supporting human thinking in certain areas\n",
    "- capable of learning in sub-areas\n",
    "- no awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "strong AI:\n",
    "- \"general intelligence\"\n",
    "(reason, logical thinking, use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judgments under uncertainty)\n",
    "- Comparable to human intelligence, but need not be the same, could be different\n",
    "- making plans\n",
    "- generally capable of learning\n",
    "- Communication skills, natural language\n",
    "- Awareness?\n",
    "- sentience, emotions?\n",
    "- self-perception?\n",

    "Let's start with a very \"old\" attempt at a definition by Arthur Samuek, an IBM pioneer:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "A good attempt, but many questions remain unanswered. Almost 40 years later, in 1998, Tom Mitchell shaped a \"well-off learning problem\" as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Well posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotation:\n",
    "A mathematical problem is called correctly (also well-posed, well-posed or properly posed) if the following conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem has a solution (existence).\n",
    "- This solution is clearly defined (uniqueness).\n",
    "- the solution's behaviour changes continuously with the initial input data (stability).\n"
