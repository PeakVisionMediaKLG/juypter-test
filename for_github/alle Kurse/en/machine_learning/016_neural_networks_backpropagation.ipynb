    "We already wrote in the previous chapters of our tutorial on Neural Networks in Python. The networks from our chapter  [Running Neural Networks](running_neural_networks.php) lack the capabilty of learning. They can only be run with randomly set weight values. So we cannot solve any classification problems with them.  However, the networks in Chapter [Simple Neural Networks](simple_neural_network.php) were capable of learning, but we only used linear networks for linearly separable classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we want to write general ANNs, which are capable of learning. To do so, we will have to understand backpropagation.  Backpropagation is a commonly used method for training artificial neural networks, especially deep neural networks. Backpropagation is needed to calculate the gradient, which we need to adapt the weights of the weight matrices. The weight of the neuron (nodes) of our network are adjusted by calculating the gradient of the loss function. For this purpose a gradient descent optimization algorithm is used. It is also called backward propagation of errors. \n",

    "Quite often people are frightened away by the mathematics used in it. \n",
    "We try to explain it in simple terms. \n",

    "Explaining gradient descent starts in many articles or tutorials with mountains. Imagine you are put on a mountain, not necessarily the top, by a helicopter at night or heavy fog. Let's further imagine that this mountain is on an island and you want to reach sea level. You have to go down, but you hardly see anything, maybe just a few metres. Your task is to find your way down, but you cannot see the path.   You can use the method of gradient descent. This means that you are examining the steepness at your current position. You will proceed in the direction with the steepest descent. You take only a few steps and then you stop again to reorientate yourself. This means you are applying again the previously described procedure, i.e. you are looking for the steepest descend. \n",
