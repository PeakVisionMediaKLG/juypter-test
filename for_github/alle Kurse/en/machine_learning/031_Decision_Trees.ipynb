This process of finding the \"most informative\" feature is done until we accomplish a stopping criteria where we then finally end up in so called **leaf nodes**. The leaf nodes contain the predictions we will make for new query instances presented to our trained model.

Lets further recapitulate the general shape of a decision tree. We know that we have at the bottom of the tree leaf nodes which contain (in the optimal case) target feature values. To make this more illustrative we use as a practical example a simplified version of the UCI machine learning Zoo Animal Classification dataset which includes properties of animals as *descriptive features*  and the and the animal species as *target feature*.

Well consider the dataset above and think about what must be done to split the dataset into a Dataset 1 containing as target feature values (species) only Mammals and a Dataset 2, containing only Reptiles.

    "That is, we have split our dataset by asking the question if the animal has hair or not. And exactly this asking and therewith splitting is the key to the decision tree models. Now in that case the splitting has been very easy because we only have a small number of descriptive features and the dataset is completely separable along the values of only one descriptive feature. However, most of the time datasets are not that easily separable and we must split the dataset more than one time (\"ask more than one question\"). Here, the next question directly arises: *Given that we have to split the dataset more than one time, that is, ask more then one question to separate the dataset, Which is the descriptive feature we should start with (root node) and in which order should we ask questions (build the interior nodes) that is, use descriptive features to split the dataset on?* Well, we have seen that using the *hair* descriptive feature seems to occupy the most information about the target feature since we only need this feature to perfectly split the dataset. Hence it would be useful to measure the \"informativeness\" of the features and use the feature with the most \"informativeness\" as the feature which should be used to split the data on. From now on, we use the term **information gain** as a measure of \"informativeness\" of a feature.

To be able to calculate the information gain, we have to first introduce the term *entropy* of a dataset. The entropy of a dataset is used to measure the impurity of a dataset and we will use this kind of informativeness measure in our calculations. There are also other types of measures which can be used to calculate the information gain. The most prominent ones are the: *Gini Index, Chi-Square, Information gain ratio, Variance*. The term entropy (in information theory) goes back to Claude E. Shannon. The idea behind the entropy is, in simplified terms, the following: Imagine you have a lottery wheel which includes 100 green balls. The set of balls within the lottery wheel can be said to be totally pure because only green balls are included. To express this in the terminology of entropy, this set of balls has a entropy of 0 (we can also say zero impurity). Consider now, 30 of these balls are replaced by red and 20 by blue balls. \n",

Since the impurity increased, the purity decreased, hence also the entropy increased. Hence we can say, the more \"impure\" a dataset, the higher the entropy and the less \"impure\" a dataset, the lower the entropy. Shannon's entropy model uses the logarithm function ($log_{2}(P(x))$) to measure the entropy and therewith the impurity of a dataset since the higher the probability of getting a specific result == P(x) (randomly drawing a green ball), the closer approaches the binary logarithm 1. \n",

Assume for instance, we say a tree is allowed to grow for only 2 seconds and then the growing process should stop - Well that would be a stopping criteria - Nonetheless, there are mainly three useful cases in which we stop the tree from growing assuming we do not stop it beforehand by defining for instance a maximum tree depth or a minimum information gain value.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "+ White box, easy to interpret model<br>\n",
    "+ No feature normalization needed<br>\n",
    "+ Tree models can handle both continuous and categorical data (Classification and Regression Trees)\n",
    "+ Can model nonlinear relationships<br>\n",
    "+ Can model interactions between the different descriptive features \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "+ If continuous features are used the tree may become quite large and hence less interpretable\n",
    "+ Decision trees are prone to overfit the training data and hence do not well generalize the data if no stopping criteria or  improvements like pruning, boosting or bagging are implemented\n",
    "+ Small changes in the data may lead to a completely different tree. This issue can be addressed by using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting or random forests\n",
    "+ Unbalanced datasets where some target feature values occur much more frequently than others may lead to biased trees since the frequently occurring feature values are preferred over the less frequently occurring ones. Facilitated: There are in general three cases why we want to grow a leaf node: If there are only pure target feature values in a sub_set --> We return this value; If the sub_dataset is empty --> We return the mode value of the original dataset; If there are no features left in the sub_dataset --> We return the mode value of the parent node. If we have now one target feature value whose frequency tops all other frequencies, it is clear why the outcome may be biased towards this value. We can address this by ensuring that the dataset is relatively balanced in terms of the target feature values\n",
    "+ If the number of features is relatively large (high dimensional) and the number of instances is relatively low, the tree might overfit the data\n",
    "+ Features with many levels may be preferred over features with less levels since for them it is \"more easy\" to split the dataset such that the sub_datasets only contain pure target feature values. This issue can be addressed by preferring for instance the information gain ratio as splitting criteria over information gain\n",
    "+ When we illustrate the target feature splitting process, we see that the tree model kind of categorizes the target feature classes into rectangular regions. Hence the tree model assumes that the underlying data can be split respectively represented by these rectangular regions.\n",

    "The first thing which has not been shown above is how to grow a tree when the descriptive features are not categorically but continuously scaled.<br>\n",
    "This does not change much from the above approach with the large difference that we can use a continuously scaled feature multiple times during the growing of the tree and we have to use the mean or mode of a feature regarding the values of the target feature instead of the single (categorical) feature values --> These can no loner be used since there is now a infinite number of different possible values.<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "The second important variation is when we do no longer have a categorically scaled but continuously scaled target feature. If this is the case we call the tree model a *regression tree model* instead of a *classification tree model*. Here as one example we can use the variance of a feature regarding the target feature as splitting criteria instead of the information gain. We then use the feature with the lowest weighted variance as splitting feature.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We said above that decision trees are prone to overfitting the training data. We also mentioned that this issue can be addressed using a method called pruning. And it is exactly what it sounds like. We prune the tree. Therefore we start at the leaf nodes and simply check if the accuracy grows if we prune the leafs and replace the parent node of these leafs by a leaf node representing the mode target feature value for this node. Following this procedure we wander up the tree until the pruning will not lead to a higher accuracy or until the pruning does not reduce the accuracy. To make a long story short, if pruning does not reduce the accuracy, prune. Done. We have found the tree which results in the maximum accuracy regarding our testing data set.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Another approach to increase the accuracy of a tree model is to use an ensemble approach. With an ensemble approach we create different models (in this case) trees from the original dataset and let the different models make a majority vote on the test dataset. That is, we predict the target values for the test dataset using each of the created models and then return this target feature value which has been predicted by the majority of the models. The most prominent approaches to create decision tree ensemble models are called *bagging* and *boosting*. A variant of a boosting-based decision tree ensemble model is called *random forest model* which is one of the most powerful machine learning algorithms. Ensemble models can also be created by using different splitting criteria for the single models such as the Gini index as well as the Information gain ratio.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now seen a lot of variations and different approaches to decision tree models. Though, there is no general guideline on which approach should be used. -There is no free lunch- As often, it depends on... and the only real advice which can be given is that you have to try different models with different hyperparameters to find the best fitting model for a specific problem. Nevertheless, ensemble models such as the random forest algorithm have proven as very powerful models.<br>\n",
