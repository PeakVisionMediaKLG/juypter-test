    "We will close the tree chapter with an algorithm called *Boosting*. Besides Random Forests, *Boosting* is another powerful approach to increase the predictive power of classical decision and regression tree models. The Boosting algorithm itself can strictly speaking neither learn nor predict anything since it  is build kind of on top of some other (weak) algorithm. The Boosting algorithm is called a \"meta algorithm\". The Boosting approach can (as well as the bootstrapping approach), be applied, in principle, to any classification or regression algorithm but it turned out that tree models are especially suited. The accuracy of boosted trees turned out to be equivalent to Random Forests with respect and even often outperforms the latter (see for instance Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil (2008)(*An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms*)). Hastie et al. (2009) call boosted decision trees the \"best off-the-shelf classifier of the world\" (Hastie et al. 2006 p.340). The mystic behind Boosting is in principal the same as for Random Forest models *-A bunch of weak learners which performs just slightly better than random guessing can be combined to make better predictions than one strong learner-*. Though, the process how these weak learners are created differs.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Recapitulate, that during the creation of our Random Forest model we used the concept of Bagging. During Bagging we have grown a number of *M* trees where each was build on a random sample (allowing resampling) of the original dataset where the random sample had the same length as the original dataset but comprises only a randomly drawn subset of the total feature space. After we have created theses models, we let them make a majority vote to make our final decision. The quintessence is that each tree model is created independent from the outcomes of the other tree models. That is, the \"shape\" of the tree model is only influenced by the \"shape\" of the underlying data which in turn is only influenced by chance (*sampling with resampling*). The main difference in the creation of bagged trees using  bootstrap aggregation and boosted trees using boosting is that we now replace the (random) resampling by some kind of *weighting* where we allocate the instances with weights and the weights of the *$n^{th}$* tree depends on the results returned by the previously created ($n^{th-1}$) tree  model. Hence, different from the Random Forest approach where we created an ensemble of tree models in parallel, we now create the ensemble in sequence, where the set up of the actual tree is influenced by the outputs of all the previous tree models by altering the weights of the dataset, the tree model is build on. The point is, that by implementing these weights, we introduce some kind of learning where the creation of the *$n^{th}$* tree in the boosted model partly depends on the predictions the *$n^{th-1}$* model has made. Therewith, we replace the more or less \"randomly-guided\" creation of the single datasets during bootstrapping by a \"guided\" creation. The most prominent boosting algorithm is called *AdaBoost* (adaptive boosting) and was developed by Freund and Schapire (1996). The following discussion is based on the AdaBoost Boosting algorithm. The following illustration gives a visual insight into the boosting algorithm.\n",

    "In the previous chapters for [Classification Trees](https://www.python-course.eu/Decision_Trees.php), [Regression Trees](https://www.python-course.eu/Regression_Trees.php) and [Random Forest models](https://www.python-course.eu/Random_Forests.php), we have always dragged along the whole \"Tree code from scratch\". I think we now have understood the concept of how to build a tree model (be it for regression or classification) from scratch in Python and if not, just go to one of the previous chapters and play around with the code! Since the power and mystic of the Boosting concept lays more in the combination of the weak learners as in the creation of these weak learners we will use [sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) to create the single weak learners but will program the actual boosting procedure from scratch. To make the sklearn DecisionTreeClassifier a *weak* classifier we will set *max_depth* parameter == 1 to create something called a *decision stump* which is in principal (as stated above) nothing else as a decision tree with only one layer, that is, the root node directly ends in leaf nodes and hence the dataset is split only once. As always, we will use the Shannon's entropy as splitting criteria. As you might see, even though we do not use our self coded Decision Tree algorithm here, the only thing we had to change in the actual tree building algorithm is that we introduce a max depth parameter which stops growing the tree after the first split - This slight change in code is actually not worth to drag it all over here - \n",

For more than 8000 testing instances we got all correct and therewith an accuracy of 100% with a model which contains 400 base learners. Also interesting is the fact, that the accuracy increases rapidly up to $\\approx$ 10 base learners and with $\\approx$ 70 base learners our model returns an accuracy of close to 100%.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Nevertheless, allow me a side node. First, this kind of boosted model is kind of computationally expensive, that is, its predictive power comes with the costs of computational expensiveness and therewith we have to make a compromise between accuracy and computation effort. Taking the above example we need $\\approx$ 400 base learners to get an accuracy of 100% but with $\\approx$ 70 decision stumps we already get close to 100%. So we have to decide how important the 100% mark is. Second, the above shown model does not claim to be computationally efficient at all. The model should show how a boosted decision stump can be created from scratch without taking care of computational efficiency. Hence, there are for sure ways how the above code can be made more efficient and therewith the model more fast. It is up to you, playing around with the code and check if you can, for instance, implement some vectorized calculations instead of the loops or something like that.\n",
