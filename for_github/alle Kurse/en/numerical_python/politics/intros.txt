To characterize a linguistic level L,
    On the other hand,
    This suggests that
    It appears that
    Furthermore,
    We will bring evidence in favor of the following thesis:
    To provide a constituent structure for T(Z,K),
    From C1, it follows that
    For any transformation which is sufficiently diversified in application to be of any interest,
    Analogously,
    Clearly,
    Note that
    Of course,
    Suppose, for instance, that
    Thus
    With this clarification,
    Conversely,
    We have already seen that
    By combining adjunctions and certain deformations,
    I suggested that these results would follow from the assumption that
    If the position of the trace in (99c) were only relatively inaccessible to movement,
    However, this assumption is not correct, since
    Comparing these examples with their parasitic gap counterparts in (96) and (97), we see that
    In the discussion of resumptive pronouns following (81),
    So far,
    Nevertheless,
    For one thing,
    Summarizing, then, we assume that
    A consequence of the approach just outlined is that
    Presumably,
    On our assumptions,
    It may be, then, that
    It must be emphasized, once again, that
    Let us continue to suppose that
    Notice, incidentally, that """
