    "## The Interpreter, an Interactive Shell\n",

    "### The Terms 'Interactive' and 'Shell'\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=200 class=\"imgright\" src=\"../images/shells.webp\" srcset=\"../images/shells_350w.webp 350w,../images/shells_300w.webp 300w\" alt=\"Python and the shell\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"interactive\" traces back to the Latin expression \"inter agere\". The verb \"agere\" means amongst other things \"to do something\" and \"to act\", while \"inter\" denotes the spatial and temporal position to things and events, i.e. \"between\" or \"among\" objects, persons, and events. So \"inter agere\" means \"to act between\" or \"to act among\" these.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we can say that the interactive shell is between the user and the operating system (e.g. Linux, Unix, Windows or others). Instead of an operating system an interpreter can be used for a programming language like Python as well. The Python interpreter can be used from an interactive shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive shell is also interactive in the way that it stands between the commands or actions and their execution. In other words, the shell waits for commands from the user, which it executes and returns the result of the execution. Afterwards, the shell waits for the next input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shell in biology is a calcium carbonate \"wall\" which protects snails or mussels from its environment or its enemies. Similarly, a shell in operating systems lies between the kernel of the operating system and the user. It's a \"protection\" in both directions. The user doesn't have to use the complicated basic functions of the OS but is capable of using the interactive shell which is relatively simple and easy to understand. The kernel is protected from unintentional and incorrect usages of system functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers a comfortable command line interface with the Python Shell, which is also known as the \"Python Interactive Shell\".\n",
    "It looks like the term \"Interactive Shell\" is a tautology, because \"shell\" is interactive on its own, at least the kind of shells we have described in the previous paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Python Interactive Shell \n",
    "With the Python interactive interpreter it is easy to check Python commands. The Python interpreter can be invoked by typing the command \"python\" without any parameter followed by the \"return\" key at the shell prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python```\n",
