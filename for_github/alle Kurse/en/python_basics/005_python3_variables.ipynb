    "Have you programmed low-level languages like C, C++ or other similar programming languages? If so, you might think you know already enough about data types and variables. You know a lot, that's right, but not enough for Python. So it's worth to go on reading this chapter on data types and variables in Python. There are dodgy differences in the way Python and C deal with variables. There are integers, floating point numbers, strings, and many more, but things are not the same as in C or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use lists or associative arrays in C e.g., you will have to construe the data type list or associative arrays from scratch, i.e., design memory structure and the allocation management. You will have to implement the necessary search and access methods as well. Python provides power data types like lists and associative arrays called \"dict\", as a genuine part of the language.\n",

    "#### General Concept of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This subchapter is especially intended for C, C++ and Java programmers, because the way these programming languages treat basic data types is different from the way Python does. Those who start learning Python as their first programming language may skip this and read the next subchapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's a variable? As the name implies, a variable is something which can change. A variable is a way of referring to a memory location used by a computer program. In many programming languages a variable is a symbolic name for this physical location. This memory location contains values, like numbers, text or more complicated types. We can use this variable to tell the computer to save some data in this location or to retrieve some data from this location.\n",

    "\n",
    "A variable can be seen as a container (or some say a pigeonhole) to store certain values. While the program is running, variables are accessed and sometimes changed, i.e., a new value will be assigned to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have said so far about variables best fits the way variables are implemented in C, C++ or Java. Variable names have to be declared in these languages before they can be used."

    "\n",
    "Putting values into the variables can be realized with assignments. The way you assign values to variables is nearly the same in all programming languages. In most cases, the equal \"=\" sign is used. The value on the right side will be saved in the variable name on the left side.\n",

E.g., if a variable is of type integer, solely integers can be saved in the variable for the duration of the program. In those programming languages every variable has to be declared before it can be used. Declaring a variable means binding it to a data type.\n",

    "### Naming Conventions\n",
    "We saw in our chapter on \"Valid Variable Names\" that we sometimes need names which consist of more than one word. We used, for example, the name \"maximum_height\". The underscore functioned as a word separator, because blanks are not allowed in variable names. Some people prefer to write variable names in the so-called CamelCase notation. We defined the variable MinimumHeight in this naming style.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a permanent \"war\" going on between the camel case followers and the underscore lovers. Personally, I definitely prefer \"the_natural_way_of_naming_things\" to \"TheNaturalWayOfNamingThings\". I think that the first one is more readable and looks more natural language like. In other words: CamelCase words are harder to read than their underscore counterparts, EspeciallyIfTheyAreVeryLong. This is my personal opinion shared by many other programmers but definitely not everybody. The Style Guide for Python Code recommends underscore notation for variable names as well as function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain names should be avoided for variable names: Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter \"L\"), 'O' (\"O\" like in \"Ontario\"), or 'I' (like in \"Indiana\") as single character variable names. They should be avoided, because these characters are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero in some fonts. When tempted to use 'l', use 'L' instead, if you cannot think of a better name anyway. The Style Guide has to say the following about the naming of identifiers in standard modules:\n",
    "\"All identifiers in the Python standard library MUST use ASCII-only identifiers, and SHOULD use English words wherever feasible (in many cases, abbreviations and technical terms are used which aren't English). In addition, string literals and comments must also be in ASCII. The only exceptions are (a) test cases testing the non-ASCII features, and (b) names of authors. Authors whose names are not based on the latin alphabet MUST provide a latin transliteration of their names.\"\n",

    "The task of the first-generation computers in the forties and fifties had been - due to technical restraints - focused on number processing. Text processing had been just a dream at that time. Nowadays, one of the main tasks of computers is text processing in all its varieties; the most prominent applications are search engines like Google. To enable text processing programming languages need suitable data types. Strings are used in all modern programming languages to store and process textual information. Logically, a string - like any text - is a sequence of characters. The question remains what a character consists of. In a book, or in a text like the one your are reading now, characters consist of graphical shapes, so-called graphemes, consisting of lines, curves and crossings in certain angles or positions and so on. The ancient Greeks associated the word with the engravings on coins or the stamps on seals.\n",

    "In computer science or computer technology, a character is a unit of information. These characters correspond to graphemes, the fundamental units of written or printed language. Before Unicode came into usage, there was a one to one relationship between bytes and characters, i.e., every character - of a national variant, i.e. not all the characters of the world - was represented by a single byte. Such a character byte represents the logical concept of this character and the class of graphemes of this character. The image above depicts various representations of the letter \"A\", i.e., \"A\" in different fonts. So in printing there are various graphical representations or different \"encodings\" of the abstract concept of the letter A. (By the way, the letter \"A\" can be ascribed to an Egyptian hieroglyph with a pictogram of an ox.) All of these graphical representations have certain features in common. In other words, the meaning of a character or a written or printed text doesn't depend on the font or writing style used. On a computer the capital A is encoded in binary form. If we use ASCII it is encoded - like all the other characters - as the byte 65.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASCII is restricted to 128 characters and \"Extended ASCII\" is is still limited to 256 bytes or characters. This is good enough for languages like English, German and French, but by far not sufficient for Chinese, Japanese and Korean. That's where Unicode gets into the game. Unicode is a standard designed to represent every character from every language, i.e., it can handle any text of the world's writing systems. These writing systems can also be used simultaneously, i.e., Roman alphabet mixed with Cyrillic or even Chinese characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a different story about Unicode. A character maps to a code point. A code point is a theoretical concept. That is, for example, that the character \"A\" is assigned a code point U+0041. The \"U+\" means \"Unicode\" and the \"0041\" is a hexadecimal number, 65 in decimal notation.\n",

One advantage of this encoding is that you can find the Nth character of a string in linear time, because the Nth character starts at the 4&times;Nth byte. A serious disadvantage of this approach is due to the fact that it needs four bytes for every character.</td>\n",

ASCII characters use solely one byte per character. This means that the first 128 characters UTF-8 are indistinguishable from ASCII. But the so-called \"Extended Latin\" characters like the Umlaute &auml;, &ouml; and so on take up two bytes. Chinese characters need three bytes. Finally, the very seldom used characters of the \"astral plane\" need four bytes to be encoded in UTF-8. <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/character_encoding\">W3Techs</a> (Web Technology Surveys) writes that \"UTF-8 is used by 94.3% of all the websites whose character encoding we know.\"</td>\n",

    "Python 3.0 uses the concepts of text and (binary) data instead of Unicode strings and 8-bit strings. Every string or text in Python 3 is Unicode, but encoded Unicode is represented as binary data. The type used to hold text is str, the type used to hold data is bytes. It's not possible to mix text and data in Python 3; it will raise TypeError.\n",
