    "In this chapter, we will cover the question of how to copy lists and nested lists. The problems which we will encounter are general problems of mutable data types. Trying to copy lists can be a stumping experience for newbies. But before, we would like to summarize some insights from the previous chapter \"[Data Types and Variables](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_variables.php)\". Python even shows a strange behaviour for the beginners of the language - in comparison with some other traditional programming languages - when assigning and copying simple data types like integers and strings. The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for compound objects, i.e. objects containing other objects, like lists or class instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code snippet, y points to the same memory location as X. We can see this by applying the id() function on x and y. However, unlike \"real\" pointers like those in C and C++, things change, when we assign a new value to y. In this case y will receive a separate memory location, as we have seen in the chapter \"[Data Types and Variables](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_variables.php)\" and can see in the following example:"
