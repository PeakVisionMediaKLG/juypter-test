    "This chapter deals with natural languages and literature. It will be also an extensive example and use case for Python sets. Novices in Python often think that sets are just a toy for mathematicians and that there is no real use case in programming. The contrary is true. There are multiple use cases for sets. They are used, for example, to get rid of doublets - multiple occurrences of elements - in a list, i.e. to make a list unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example we will use sets to determine the different words occurring in a novel. Our use case is build around a novel which has been praised by many, and regarded as the best novel in the English language and also as the hardest to read. We are talking about the novel \"Ulysses\" by James Joyce. We will not talk about or examine the beauty of the language or the language style. We will study the novel by having a close look at the words used in the novel. Our approach will be purely statitical. The claim is that James Joyce used in his novel more words than any other author. Actually his vocabulary is above and beyond all other authors, maybe even Shakespeare.\n",
