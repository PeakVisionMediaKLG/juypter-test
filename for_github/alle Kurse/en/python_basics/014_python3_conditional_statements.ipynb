    "\n",
    "Conditions - usually in the form of if statements - are one of the key features of a programming language, \n",
    "and Python is no exception. You will hardly find a programming language without an if statement.<sup>1</sup> \n",

    "A decision must be made when the script or program comes to a point where there \n",

    "\n",
    "The decision, in most cases, depends on the value of variables or arithmetic expressions. \n",
    "These expressions are evaluated using the Boolean True or False values. The instructions \n",
    "for decision making are called conditional statements.\n",
    "In a programming language, therefore, the parts of the conditional statements are executed under the given conditions. In many cases there are two code parts: \n",
    "One which will be executed, if the condition is True, and another one, if it \n",
    "is False. In other words, a branch determines which of two (or even more) \n",
    "program parts (alternatives) will be executed depending on one (or more) conditions. \n",
    "Conditional statements and branches belong to the control structures of programming \n",
    "languages, because with their help a program can react to different states that result \n",

    "Of course, as we all know, there will be no time left to file the tax return. Jokes aside: in the previous text, as you see, we have a sequence of actions that must be performed in chronological order. If you take a closer look at the text, you will find some ambiguity in it: is 'the painting of the walls' also related to the event of the rain? Will the tax declaration be done with or without rain? What will this person do, if it does not rain? Therefore, we extend the text with additional alternatives:\n",

    "To encode conditional statements in Python, we need to know how to combine statements into a block. So this seems to be the ideal moment to introduce the Python Block Principle in combination with the conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Statements into Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, blocks are used to treat sets of statements as if they were a single statement. A block consists of one or more statements. A program can be considered a block consisting of statements and other nested blocks. In programming languages, there exist various approaches to syntactically describing blocks: ALGOL 60 and Pascal, for example, use \"begin\" and \"end\", while C and similar languages use curly braces \"{\" and \"}\". Bash has another design that uses 'do ... done' and 'if ... fi' or 'case ... esac' constructs.\n",
    "All these languages have in common is that the indentation style is not binding. The problems that may arise from this will be shown in the next subchapter. You can safely skip this, if you are only interested in Python. For inexperienced programmers, this chapter may seem a bit difficult.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Excursion to C\n",
    "    \n",
    "For all these approaches, there is a big drawback: The code may be fine for the interpreter or compiler of the language, but it can be written in a way that is poorly structured for humans. We want to illustrate this in the following \"pseudo\" C-like code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "if (raining_tomorrow) {\n",
    "    tidy_up_the_cellar(); \n",
    "    paint_the_walls();\n",
    "    if (time_left) \n",
    "          do_taxes();\n",
    "} else\n",
    "    enjoy_swimming();\n",
    "go_cinema();\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will add a couple of spaces in front of calling 'go_cinema'. This puts this call at the same level as 'enjoy_swimming':\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "if (raining_tomorrow) {\n",
    "    tidy_up_the_cellar(); \n",
    "    paint_the_walls();\n",
    "    if (time_left) \n",
    "          do_taxes();\n",
    "} else\n",
    "    enjoy_swimming();\n",
    "    go_cinema();\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution of the program will not change: you will go to the cinema, whether it will be raining or not!\n",
    "However, the way the code is written falsely suggests that you will only go to the\n",
    "cinema if it does not rain. This example shows the possible ambiguity\n",
    "in the interpretation of C code by humans. In other words, you can inadvertently write the code,\n",
    "which leads to a procedure that does not \"behave\" as intended.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this example lurks even another danger. What if the programmer had just forgotten to put the last statement out of the curly braces? \n",
    "\n",
    "Should the code look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",

    "</pre>\n",

    "In the following program you will only go to the cinema, if it is not a rainy day. \n",
    "That only makes sense if it's an open-air cinema.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code is the right code to go to the movies regardless of the weather:\n",
    "\n",

    "    enjoy_swimming();\n",
    "}\n",
    "go_cinema();}\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with C is that the way the code is indented has no meaning for the compiler, but it can lead to misunderstanding, if misinterpreted.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "This is different in Python. Blocks are created with indentations, in other words, blocks are based on indentation. We can say \"What you see is what you get!\"\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The example above might look like this in a Python program:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "if raining_tomorrow:\n",
    "    tidy_up_the_cellar() \n",
    "    paint_the_walls()\n",
    "    if time_left: \n",

    "else:\n",
    "    enjoy_swimming()\n",
    "go_cinema()\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no ambiguity in the Python version. The cinema visit of the couple will take place in any case, regardless\n",
    "of the weather. Moving the go_cinema() call to the same indentation level as enjoy_swimming() immediately changes the program logic. In that case, there will be no cinema if it rains.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "We have just seen that it is useful to use indentations in C or C++ programs\n",
    "to increase the readability of a program. For the compilation or execution of a program they are\n",
    "but irrelevant. The compiler relies exclusively on the structuring determined by the brackets.\n",
    "Code in Python, on the other hand, can only be structured with indents. That is,\n",
    "Python forces the programmer to use indentation that should be used anyway to write nice and readable\n",
    "codes. Python does not allow you to obscure the structure of a program by misleading indentations.\n",

    "- A leap year is a calendar year containing an additional day added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year. In the Gregorian calendar, each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by extending February to 29 days rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in years which are multiples of four (with the exception of centennial years not divisible by 400). Write a Python program, which asks for a year and calculates, if this year is a leap year or not.\n",
