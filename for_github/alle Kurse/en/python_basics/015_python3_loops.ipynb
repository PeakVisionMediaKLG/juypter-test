    "### General Structure of a Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Many algorithms make it necessary for a programming language to have a construction which makes it possible to carry out a sequence of statements repeatedly. The code within the loop, i.e. the code carried out repeatedly, is called the body of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, there are three different kinds of loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Count-controlled loops\n",
    "  A construction for repeating a loop a certain number of times. An example of this kind of loop is the for-loop of the programming language C:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    for (i=0; i <= n; i++)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Python doesn't have this kind of loop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Condition-controlled loop\n",
    "    A loop will be repeated until a given condition changes, i.e. changes from True to False or from False to True, depending on the kind of loop. There are 'while loops' and 'do while' loops with this behaviour.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Collection-controlled loop\n",
    "    This is a special construct which allows looping through the elements of a 'collection', which can be an array, list or other ordered sequence. Like the for loop of the bash shell (e.g. for i in *, do echo $i; done) or the foreach loop of Perl.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=300 height=300 src=\"../images/while_loop_1.webp\" alt=\"Flowchart of a loop\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supplies two different kinds of loops: the while loop and the for loop, which correspond to the condition-controlled loop and collection-controlled loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most loops contain a counter or more generally, variables, which change their values in the course of calculation. These variables have to be initialized before the loop is started. The counter or other variables, which can be altered in the body of the loop, are contained in the condition. Before the body of the loop is executed, the condition is evaluated. If it evaluates to False, the while loop is finished. In other words, the program flow will continue with the first statement after the while statement, i.e. on the same indentation level as the while loop. If the condition is evaluated to True, the body, - the indented block below the line with \"while\" - gets executed. After the body is finished, the condition will be evaluated again. The body of the loop will be executed as long as the condition yields True.\n",

    "It's best to illustrate the operating principle of a loop with a simple Python example. The following small script calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100. We will later introduce a more elegant way to do it."

    "So far, a while loop only ends, if the condition in the loop head is fulfilled. With the help of a break statement a while loop can be left prematurely, i.e. as soon as the control flow of the program comes to a break inside of a while loop (or other loops) the loop will be immediately left. \"break\" shouldn't be confused with the continue statement. \"continue\" stops the current iteration of the loop and starts the next iteration by checking the condition.\n",

The program informs the player, if this number is larger, smaller or equal to the secret number, i.e. the number which the program has randomly created. If the player wants to gives up, he or she can input a 0 or a negative number.\n",
