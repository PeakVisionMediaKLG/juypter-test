    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Like the while loop the for loop is a programming language statement, i.e. an iteration statement, which allows a code block to be repeated a certain number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are hardly any programming languages without for loops, but the for loop exists in many different flavours, i.e. both the syntax and the semantics differs from one programming language to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different kinds of for loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Count-controlled for loop (Three-expression for loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is by far the most common type. This statement is the one used by C. The header of this kind of for loop consists of a three-parameter loop control expression. Generally it has the form:\n",
    "    for (A; Z; I)\n",
    "    A is the initialisation part, Z determines a termination expression and I is the counting expression, where the loop variable is incremented or dcremented. An example of this kind of loop is the for-loop of the programming language C:\n",
    "    for (i=0; i <= n; i++)\n",
    "  This kind of for loop is not implemented in Python!\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Numeric Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "    This kind of for loop is a simplification of the previous kind. It's a counting or enumerating loop. Starting with a start value and counting up to an end value, like for i = 1 to 100\n",
    "    Python doesn't use this either.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Vectorized for loops\n",
    "\n",
    "    They behave as if all iterations are executed in parallel. That is, for example, all expressions on the right side of assignment statements get evaluated before the assignments.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Iterator-based for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, we come to the one used by Python. This kind of for loop iterates over an enumeration of a set of items. It is usually characterized by the use of an implicit or explicit iterator. In each iteration step a loop variable is set to a value in a sequence or other data collection. This kind of for loop is known in most Unix and Linux shells and it is the one which is implemented in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax of the For Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, the Python for loop is an iterator based for loop. It steps through the items of lists, tuples, strings, the keys of dictionaries and other iterables. The Python for loop starts with the keyword \"for\" followed by an arbitrary variable name, which will hold the values of the following sequence object, which is stepped through. The general syntax looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "for <variable> in <sequence>:\n",
    "\t<statements>\n",
    "else:\n",
    "\t<statements>"

    "The else block is special; while Perl programmer are familiar with it, it's an unknown concept to C and C++ programmers. Semantically, it works exactly as the optional else of a while loop. It will be executed only if the loop hasn't been \"broken\" by a break statement. So it will only be executed, after all the items of the sequence in the header have been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a break statement has to be executed in the program flow of the for loop, the loop will be exited and the program flow will continue with the first statement following the for loop, if there is any at all. Usually break statements are wrapped into conditional statements, e.g."
