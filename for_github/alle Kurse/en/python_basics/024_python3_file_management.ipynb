    "It's hard to find anyone in the 21st century, who doesn't know what a file is. When we say file, we mean of course, a file on a computer. There may be people who don't know anymore the \"container\", like a cabinet or a folder, for keeping papers archived in a convenient order. A file on a computer is the modern counterpart of this. It is a collection of information, which can be accessed and used by a computer program. Usually, a file resides on a durable storage. Durable means that the data is persistent, i.e. it can be used by other programs after the program which has created or manipulated it, has terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term file management in the context of computers refers to the manipulation of data in a file or files and documents on a computer. Though everybody has an understanding of the term file, we present a formal definition anyway:\n",
    "\n",
    "A file or a computer file is a chunk of logically related data or information which can be used by computer programs. Usually a file is kept on a permanent storage media, e.g. a hard drive disk. A unique name and path is used by human users or in programs or scripts to access a file for reading and modification purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"file\" - as we have described it in the previous paragraph - appeared in the history of computers very early. Usage can be tracked down to the year 1952, when punch cards where used.\n",
    "\n",
    "A programming language without the capability to store and retrieve previously stored information would be hardly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic tasks involved in file manipulation are reading data from files and writing or appending data to files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading and Writing Files in Python\n",
    "The syntax for reading and writing files in Python is similar to programming languages like C, C++, Java, Perl, and others but a lot easier to handle.\n",

So, we will show you, how you can save your data in an easy way that you or better your program can reread them at a later date again. We are \"pickling\" the data, so that nothing gets lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers a module for this purpose, which is called \"pickle\". With the algorithms of the pickle module we can serialize and de-serialize Python object structures. \"Pickling\" denotes the process which converts a Python object hierarchy into a byte stream, and \"unpickling\" on the other hand is the inverse operation, i.e. the byte stream is converted back into an object hierarchy. What we call pickling (and unpickling) is also known as \"serialization\" or \"flattening\" a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object can be dumped with the dump method of the pickle module:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre> pickle.dump(obj, file[,protocol, *, fix_imports=True])</pre>\n",

    "dump() writes a pickled representation of obj to the open file object file. The optional protocol argument tells the pickler to use the given protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Protocol version 0 is the original (before Python3) human-readable (ascii) protocol and is backwards compatible with previous versions of Python.\n",
    "-   Protocol version 1 is the old binary format which is also compatible with previous versions of Python.\n",
    "-   Protocol version 2 was introduced in Python 2.3. It provides much more efficient pickling of new-style classes.\n",
    "-   Protocol version 3 was introduced with Python 3.0. It has explicit support for bytes and cannot be unpickled by Python 2.x pickle modules. It's the recommended protocol of Python 3.x.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default protocol of Python3 is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "If fix_imports is True and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try to map the new Python3 names to the old module names used in Python2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects which have been dumped to a file with pickle.dump can be reread into a program by using the method pickle.load(file). pickle.load recognizes automatically, which format had been used for writing the data.\n",

    "<pre>\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "\n",
    "cities = [\"Paris\", \"Dijon\", \"Lyon\", \"Strasbourg\"]\n",

The solution is easy: We pack the objects into another object, so we will only have to pickle one object again.

    "### shelve Module\n",
    "One drawback of the pickle module is that it is only capable of pickling one object at the time, which has to be unpickled in one go. Let's imagine this data object is a dictionary. It may be desirable that we don't have to save and load every time the whole dictionary, but save and load just a single value corresponding to just one key. The shelve module is the solution to this request. A \"shelf\" - as used in the shelve module - is a persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with dbm databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be essentially arbitrary Python objects -- anything that the \"pickle\" module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing lots of shared sub-objects. The keys have to be strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shelve module can be easily used. Actually, it is as easy as using a dictionary in Python. Before we can use a shelf object, we have to import the module. After this, we have to open a shelve object with the shelve method open. The open method opens a special shelf file for reading and writing:\n",

So city will be a list with the words of the city, e.g. [\"Salt\", \"Lake\", \"City\"]. \" \".join(city) turns such a list into a \"proper\" string with the city name, i.e. in our example \"Salt Lake City\".
