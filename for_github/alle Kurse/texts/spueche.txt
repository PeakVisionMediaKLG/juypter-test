Python is executable pseudocode. Perl is executable line noise.

Python amplifies your brain. 

Python is probably the most lisp-like mainstream language.

Python just feels right to me. It feels clean, it feels poetic, it feels
beautiful.

Python is for people who want to program, not REAL WORLD programmers.

With Lisp or Forth, a master programmer has unlimited power and
expressiveness. With Python, even a regular guy can reach for the stars. 
(Raymond Hettinger, a core Python developer)


You don't need types, types are for girls.

like Lisp but my company won't let me use it. What should I do?
Try to get them to let you use Python.

Basically, Python can be seen as a dialect of Lisp with "traditional" syntax
(what Lisp people call "infix" or "m-lisp" syntax). [..] Python supports all
of Lisp's essential features except macros, and you don't miss macros all that
much because it does have eval, and operator overloading, and regular
expression parsing, so you can create custom languages that way.
