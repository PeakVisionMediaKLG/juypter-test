2: Frozen wind began to blow
3: Under my boots and around my toes
4: The frost that bit the ground below
5: It was a hundred degrees below zero...

7: And my mama cried
8: And my mama cried
9: Nanook, a-no-no
10: Nanook, a-no-no
11: Don't be a naughty Eskimo
12: Save your money, don't go to the show

14: Well I turned around and I said "Oh, oh" Oh
15: Well I turned around and I said "Oh, oh" Oh
16: Well I turned around and I said "Ho, Ho"
17: And the northern lights commenced to glow
18: And she said, with a tear in her eye
19: "Watch out where the huskies go, and don't you eat that yellow snow"
20: "Watch out where the huskies go, and don't you eat that yellow snow"
